The file Lap2D_example.mw is the Maple worksheet.
It can be read using "xmaple"

I have read in Lap2D_example.mw and generated a
file: Lap2D_example.txt, which I hope will be 
useful as a template for the Maple DSL work.

While in xmaple I was able to generate the
C code and Fortran code for the associated 
discretization.  

The goal is to generate Maple code from ROSE
and for the 2D laplacian this would be:
   Lap2D := w -> DPDMx(w)+DPDMy(w):
