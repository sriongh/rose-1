Need to generate stack types accessed for each function.
Ultimately we want to generate the C types of varaibles
access on the stack. For example:
   int
   long
   char
   unsigned short
And then generate the list of permutations that would
represent possible class structures.  An additional
analysis is then possible to see hw data members are used 
in the program and with type inforamtion from other
source (e.g. function prototype signatures via FLIRT), 
each entry can be qualified. It may be that this can be
posed as a solution to a sytem of constraint equations.
I think this may be the best that can be done.

Initial work should just identify the types as defined
by the opcodes and more readily avaiable in ROSE.



Future Work:
   Dumper design (example file)
   Object oriented bot source code
   Query control flow / Data via library
   Detect improper CDecl and Standard Call Calling Convention
