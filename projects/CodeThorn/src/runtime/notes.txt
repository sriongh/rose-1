new Foo is actually: new (operator new(sizeof(Foo)) Foo) 
delete a is actually: a->~Foo(); operator delete(a);

delete var; 
==>
delete var->~<nameOf<typeOf<var>>();
rts.registerForCommit(var);

Those "disjoint allocation/release from construct/destroy" forms are
rare, but happen when the history of the memory doesn't follow the
history of the object it holds. This is typically found -for example-
in std::vector implementations.
