/** Base class for engines driving the partitioner.
 *
 *  A partitioner engine defines the sequence of operations to perform on a partitioner in order to discover instructions,
 *  basic blocks, data blocks, and functions.  Users need not use an engine at all if they prefer to run each step explicitly,
 *  but if they do, there are a few ways to do so:
 *
 *  @li Use an existing engine directly without tweaking it in any way.  This is probably how ROSE @c frontend and may of the
 *      ROSE tools operate.
 *
 *  @li Subclass an engine and override some of its functions with new implementations.
 *
 *  @li Modify the partitioner on which the engine operates either by subclassing or by registering callbacks.
 *
 *  Although this class has quite a few methods, they are intended to be mostly simple things that are easy to replace in
 *  subclasses. */
