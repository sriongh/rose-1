/** Base class for engines driving the partitioner.
 *
 *  An engine serves two purposes:
 *
 *  @li It provides a number of utility methods for preparing specimens to be partitioned, namely steps that parse the binary
 *      container (ELF, PE, etc), map sections into virtual memory, perform optional dynamic linking and relocation fixups,
 *      apply map resource strings ("map:" files), and choose disassembler based on architecture.
 *
 *  @li It provides a number of wrapper methods and algorithms for using a partitioner to organize instructions into basic
 *      blocks and functions.
 *
 *  Users need not use an engine at all if they don't want to -- everything the engine does can (and was previously) done at
 *  the user level with calls to other APIs.  However, using an engine for as many steps as possible will mean that user code
 *  will automatically benefit from improvements such as new algorithms.
 *
 *  Besides reimplementing engine algorithms in user code, a user can also modify behavior in these other ways:
 *
 *  @li The engine is intended to be a base class for user subclasses so the user can override individual algorithms and still
 *      use the other algorithms.
 *
 *  @li The engine API is written in terms of individual steps where the user has a chance to change things between steps.
 *      Each step will automatically execute any previous steps that are necessary. The main steps are: @ref parse, @ref load,
 *      and @ref partition.
 *
 *  @li The engine's partitioning API always takes a partitioner as an argument. The user can modify the partitioner's behavior
 *      by subclassing, registering partitioner callbacks, or modifying the partitioner state between calls to the
 *      engine. However, the partitioner that's provided to these functions should be one that was created with one of the
 *      partitioner-creating functions in this library if you want all features to work. */
